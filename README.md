![Ask a flowchart: Should I quit my tech job?](/README-img/main.png)
Simple web app, an interactive flowchart that answers the question **"Should I quit my job?"**

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, and Bootstrap. The current version has been refactor to separate the *Model*, *View* and *Controller/ViewModel* (called *Octopus* in my code). No organization JS library was used in this code, just plain vanilla JavaScript. [Live production version!](http://reye.sh/f1)
